                    "Sam Stone" is a song written by John Prine about a drug-addicted veteran with a Purple Heart and
                    <br>
                    his death by overdose. It appeared on Prine's eponymous 1971 debut album. The song was originally
                    <br>
                    titled "Great Society Conflict Veteran's Blues".<br>
                    The most familiar refrain in the song is "There's a hole in daddy's arm, where all the money goes."<br>
                    The song is usually interpreted as a reference to the phenomenon of heroin or morphine addiction<br>
                    among Vietnam war veterans. (An identical surge of addiction followed the Civil War, where morphine<br>
                    addiction was known as 'Soldiers Disease'). The song does not mention the Vietnam War, saying only<br>
                    that Sam returned from "serving in the conflict overseas." There is a single explicit reference to<br>
                    morphine but Prine alludes to heroin on several occasions including the use of the term "habit,"<br>
                    slang commonly associated with heroin use, and the line "he popped his last balloon," very likely<br>
                    referring to one of the ways in which street heroin is commonly packaged â€“ in small rubber<br>
                    balloons.

                <h1> Lyrics </h1>
                <p class="lyrics">Sam Stone came home,<br>
                    To the wife and family<br>
                    After serving in the conflict overseas.<br>
                    And the time that he served,<br>
                    Had shattered all his nerves,<br>
                    And left a little shrapnel in his knees.<br>
                    But the morhpine eased the pain,<br>
                    And the grass grew round his brain,<br>
                    And gave him all the confidence he lacked,<br>
                    With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.<br>
                    <br>
                    There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,<br>
                    Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.<br>
                    Little pitchers have big ears,<br>
                    Don't stop to count the years,<br>
                    Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sam Stone's welcome home<br>
                    Didn't last too long.<br>
                    He went to work when he'd spent his last dime<br>
                    And soon he took to stealing<br>
                    When he got that empty feeling<br>
                    For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.<br>
                    And the gold roared through his veins<br>
                    Like a thousand railroad trains,<br>
                    And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,<br>
                    While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...<br>
                    <br>
                    There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,<br>
                    Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.<br>
                    Little pitchers have big ears,<br>
                    Don't stop to count the years,<br>
                    Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.<br>
                    Sam Stone was alone<br>
                    When he popped his last balloon,<br>
                    Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.<br>
                    Well, he played his last request,<br>
                    While the room smelled just like death,<br>
                    With an overdose hovering in the air.<br>
                    But life had lost it's fun,<br>
                    There was nothing to be done,<br>
                    But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,<br>
                    For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.<br>
                    <br>
                    There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,<br>
                    Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.<br>
                    Little pitchers have big ears,<br>
                    Don't stop to count the years,<br>
                    Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.<br>
