Step 1

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.
Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.
â€¢	To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
â€¢	To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.
npm package manager
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.
This Quick Start uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.
To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.
